# Global-Health-Population-Dashboard

##  Project Overview

This project, developed for the ALY6070 course at Northeastern University, explores global population and health trends using data from the World DataBank. The goal was to provide actionable insights through interactive dashboards built with Tableau, focusing on urban-rural distribution, age dependency, and healthcare demand across global regions.

##  Dataset

**Source:** [World DataBank - The World Bank Group](https://databank.worldbank.org)

- **Total Records:** 125,025+
- **Features:** 19 columns
- **Coverage:** Global, across multiple countries and regions
- **Indicators:** Includes Adolescent fertility rate, Child malnutrition, Access to basic sanitation, HIV rates, age dependency ratios, and more.

##  Dashboards Overview

### 1. Rural and Urban Population Analysis
- Tracks annual growth in urban and rural areas across countries.
- Identifies nations with the highest rural vs. urban population over time.
- Compares growth trends and visualizes the shift toward urbanization.

### 2. Age Dependency & Population Structure
- Created by Nishthaben Vaghani.
- Shows comparative youth dependency ratios and working-age burdens.
- Treemap highlights regional disparities in age structure, with Sub-Saharan Africa contributing heavily to global youth dependency.

### 3. Health Indicators in West & South Africa
- Compares birth and death rates across West African countries.
- Highlights rising healthcare demand in high-growth regions like Nigeria and Senegal.
- Shows HIV prevalence trends in South Africa from 2009 to 2023.

##  Key Insights

- Countries like Niger and Mali face the highest youth dependency ratios (over 1,400 dependents per 1,000 working-age adults).
- Sub-Saharan and Central African regions need urgent investment in youth services and infrastructure.
- Urbanization trends show a global shift, requiring adaptive public health policies.
- HIV population data reveals critical trends for long-term healthcare planning.
